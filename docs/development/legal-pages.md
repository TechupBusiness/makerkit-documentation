Legal pages are defined in the `apps/web/app/routes/marketing` directory.

Makerkit comes with the following legal pages:

1. Terms and Conditions
2. Privacy Policy
3. Cookie Policy

For obvious reasons, **these pages are empty and you need to fill in the content**.

Do yourself a favor and do not use ChatGPT to generate these pages.
