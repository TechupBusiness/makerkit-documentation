This kit is the latest version of the React Router Supabase SaaS Kit, which is a React Router starter kit for building SaaS applications with Supabase.

Compared to the previous kit, this kit has been updated with more functionality, more organized code, and mode modern dependencies.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, sign out, and forgot password.
- **Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA for your account.
- **Personal Accounts**: Users have their own personal accounts (besides the organization account).

- **CMSs**: The kit supports multiple CMSs, such as Keystatic and Wordpress

## A Modular, Extensible and Modern SaaS Starter Kit

The biggest change in this kit is the modular structure. This allows us to:

- plug new features easily into the kit with no (or minimal) changes to the existing codebase.
- maintain the kit more easily.
- better separate the "core" features from your custom features.
- add additional modules (billing, CMS, monitoring, logger, mailer, etc.) to the kit.

And more!
